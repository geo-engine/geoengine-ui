    <p>The <span class="vat">Vat</span> system's goal is to support interactive data exploration by tracking the data processing
        automatically in the
        background. You can view the complete processing workflow for individual layers by selecting <i>Lineage</i> in the layer
        context menu and the lineage for all layers by clicking on the context menu of the layer list in the top left.</p>
