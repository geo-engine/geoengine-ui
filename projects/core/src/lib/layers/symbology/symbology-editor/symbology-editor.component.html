                    Vector features are shown in the map as points, lines or polygons. Points and polygons have a fill color. All vector
                    features have a stroke. Points have additionally a <i>radius</i> since they are displayed as circles. You can always
                    specify default visualization parameters. You can adapt the stroke width and color. Points and Polygons have a fill
                    color. As all other global settings, this is overwritten by other style rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each setting has a default value, which is used if no additional rule applies. Additional rules are derived values. If
                    you specify a derived attribute name, your style is based on the feature values. For instance, you can specify a numeric
                    column to be used as a radius for a point feature.

                    The <i>Global Layer Properties</i> define the default visualization parameters. The layer <i>Opacity</i> is adjustable
                    in a range from 0 to 100 %. You can choose a <i>NoData</i> color for pixels with the nodata value. Use the picker tool
                    to select the desired RGB color and opacity. This also applies to the <i>Overflow</i> color, which indicates the pixels
                    with values without coloring rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <i>Color Map</i> section provides an overview of the pixel values with a frequency plot, which also allows to adapt
                    the color with respect to the raster values. The plot refers to the field of view shown in the map. If
                    <i>Sync map and histogram </i> is turned on, the histogram updates if the map view changes. To specify the value range
                    of interest, you can set a minimum and maximum pixel value. You can choose a color ramp from a variety of color schemes
                    (<i>Colormap name</i>) and reverse it, if desired. Additionally, different functions for the step distribution can be
                    selected (linear, logarithmic, square root function, square function). Consider that the logarithmic function requires
                    positive values (>0). The number of Color steps is also kept flexible and can be set to a number between 2 and 16. Click
                    <i>Create color table</i> to apply your adjustments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <i> Color Table section </i> allows fine grained changes to colors. The gradient defines the interpolation between
                    values. You can dynamically add and remove color steps by clicking the minus and plus symbols or select distinct RGBA
                    values for a specific color step value.
